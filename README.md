# Kron

This service can be used to check the state of stateless, non-daeomonized and worker type apps in a simple way.

The app or the user can specify an http request to be made, and Kron will make that request and if it doesn't recieve the expected response, notify the user.

This can be used as a healthcheck, cron job manager, etc.
